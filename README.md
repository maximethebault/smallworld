# SmallWorld

## Project
This project is a game. It's a mix between Small World and Civilization.

## Context
This project was carried out in the context of an engineering school's course (object-oriented analysis/design/programming).

## Technologies

The user interface is written in WPF/C#, and thus uses the MVVM architectural pattern (as much as possible).
The business logic is written in C# as well, but it relies on a C++ library to run some algorithms.
To link C# & C++, managed C++ (C++/CLI) was used.
